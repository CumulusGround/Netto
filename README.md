## A back-end based project

This is my second "from scratch" project highlighting my newly aquire back-end skills.

### The Brief

We had 2 1/2 days to complete a CRUD app of our choice which would demonstrate our skills in database manipulations.

### My Project

I decided to create an app that would help you remember the people you meet, their key characteristic and who were they link to. A social network you could say..

### Technology Used

- Back-end: Ruby, SQL with PostGreSQL, Sinatra, Heroku for deployment
- Front-end: HTML, CSS
- Methodologies: MVC architecture, RESTful routes, CRUD
- Design: Sketch, Trello, materiapalette.com and Google Fonts

Font used:

### Story

**Day 1:** I decide to do my design, research and doing  This was quite an exciting time, the "dreaming state". After I had a good concept in mind, I decide to work on the repositories architecture, app_console,etc..

**Day2** The goal here was to create the MVC. Halfway through I realise that I could have cut down on the number of data fields for that purpose as it was getting tydious for no reason at this stage. 
I did basic styling as well
I got the MVC done by 5pm.

**Day 3** Was the big CSS day.
After an hour or two of research online to be clearer about *HOW* to design my "main hub", I was totally stuck because I could find what I wanted.
I reached out to two friends to ask for pointers.
Whilst they showed me the technologies to use, I understood I wasn't gonna achieve it in a day as the knolwedge was a bit too far out for my current level. I felt sad but hopeful for the future.

Hence after 3/4hours of research, I had to pivot and and redesign the hub with a more simplistic design to make the deadline.
Once I was happy, I started to create the search function and the dependencie technology.
This was an important part of the project as I wanted to visually show the relationship between people/cards.

I first encounter some difficulties at the database and routing levels but this got solved by clarifying my thoughts, renaming variables and a some pseudocode.

In the end, we have a clean, joyful little app to create better social interaction.

You'll never forget your friend's friend name anymore.

#### My Key Takeways / What I Learned

- Planning, planning, planning.
- The importance of data formatting going into the database for easier query later.
- How to handle PG "nil" requests.
- Doing the MVP with truly the less amount of variables possible....
